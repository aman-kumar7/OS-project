Question 18. Ten students (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j) are going to attend an event. There are lots of gift shops, they all are going to the gift shops and randomly picking the gifts. 
After picking the gifts they are randomly arriving in the billing counter. The accountant gives the preference to that student who has maximum number of gifts. 
Create a C or Java program to define order of billed students?

Question 45. If a teacher is being served and during the period when he is being served another teacher comes, then that teacher would get the service next. 
This process might continue leading to increase in waiting time of students. Write a C program to ensure in your program that the waiting time of students is minimized. 
Assume values of arrival time, burst time by your own.
